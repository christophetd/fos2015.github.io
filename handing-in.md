### Submission Procedure

1. Zip your project directory, making sure that you haven't created or removed any files from the provided template for the corresponding project. For instance, if the template contained files Arithmetic.scala and Terms.scala in /src/main/scala/fos, don't move these files around or create additional helper files.

1. Send the archive produced during the previous step to the email address specified in the welcome message of the mailing list.
  * The subject of the email should be "Project X (YYYYYY, ZZZZZZ, ...)", where X is the number of the project, and YYYYYY/ZZZZZZ/... are SCIPER numbers of the authors.
  * The body of the email doesn't matter, because our grading bot can't read.
  * Don't forget the attachment.

1. Wait for a response from the grading bot. The response will either contain a rejection notice along with the detailed error message or an acceptance notice with the results of running your submission against our test suite.

1. If you don't receive a response from the bot, or you get your submission rejected without a good reason, contact the staff.


1. If you're not content with your results, follow the instructions in the reply email to try and improve your score. You can retry the submission as many times as you want, and that won't result in any penalties to your final score.

### Late Submissions

If you miss a deadline, you can still submit your project, however your grade will be reduced. Late submissions will be graded with 30% deduction of points for every day after the deadline.
