### Submission Procedure

For handing in, follow this procedure:

1. Zip your project directory, making sure that you haven't created or removed any files from the provided template for the corresponding project. For instance, if the template contained files Arithmetic.scala and Terms.scala in /src/main/scala/fos, don't move them around or create additional helpers.
1. Send the archive produced during the previous step to the email address specified on the course mailing list.
1. Wait for an acceptance email from the grading bot along with the results of running your submission against our test suite. If you don't receive a response from the bot, or you get your submission rejected without a good reason, contact the teaching assistants. If you're not content with your results, follow the instructions in the reply email to try and improve your score.

### Late Submissions

If you miss a deadline, you can still submit your project, however your grade will be reduced. Late submissions will be graded with 30% deduction of points for every day after the deadline.
