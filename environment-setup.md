###  Environment Setup

These days, getting started with Scala is very easy:

1. Visit the website of the [Scala IDE](http://scala-ide.org/) to download a distribution of Eclipse with a pre-installed Scala plugin.
1. Launch the downloaded application
1. Go to menu File > Import > Existing Project into Workspace
1. Point select root directory to the folder where you unarchived assignment skeleton
1. Click finish

You should be all set. If you don't like Eclipse, feel free to use alternative IDEs or even develop in console, as long as your project [passes our tests](http://lamp.epfl.ch/page-125161-en.html).
