###  Environment Setup

These days, getting started with Scala is very easy:

1. Download Eclipse with built-in Scala plugin at [http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html](http://scala-ide.org/download/sdk.html)
1. Launch the downloaded application
1. Go to menu `File > Import > Existing Project into Workspace`
1. Select the directory where you unarchived the skeleton of your assignment
1. Click `Finish`

You should be all set. If you don't like Eclipse, feel free to use alternative IDEs or even develop in console, as long as your project [passes our tests](/handing-in.html).
